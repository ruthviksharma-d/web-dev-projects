# spotify-clone
Spotify clone built solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a front-end focused project that emulates the basic functionality and visual design of Spotify.<br><hr>
It involves creating a user interface with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements like playback controls, playlist management, and a rudimentary music library. Due to the absence of a backend or external API integration, the project is limited to local or pre-defined audio files, and user features are confined to those manageable within the browser's capabilities. Essentially, it's a demonstration of front-end web development skills applied to a familiar music streaming interface.
