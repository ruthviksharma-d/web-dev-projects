# 🌐 Web Development Projects Hub

Welcome to the central repository for all of my web development projects. This repo uses **Git submodules** to organize and manage each project individually while keeping them under one roof for easy access and collaboration.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project is included as a submodule. To clone this repository with all submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ruthviksharma-d/repo-name.git
```

If you've already cloned the repo without `--recurse-submodules`, initialize and update the submodules like this:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
